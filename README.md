This repository demonstrates a common issue in React applications where the `useEffect` hook causes unnecessary re-renders due to an improperly specified dependency array. The `bug.js` file showcases the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The problem arises when a value used within the effect is not explicitly listed in the dependency array, leading to unexpected behavior and potential performance issues.
